                    There are nights when I’m working as a customer service rep, running on barely four hours of sleep, and I ask myself a simple question: why am I doing this to myself? I could have chosen an easier path, one with more rest and fewer responsibilities. But
                    every time that question comes up, the answer stays the same, I’m working toward a future version of myself that I believe in. As a computer science student and a working student, my journey is far from smooth, but it’s intentional.

                    In the next five years, I see myself working as a software engineer, ideally in AI development or game development. I’ve always been fascinated by how systems think, react, and evolve, whether that’s through intelligent algorithms or interactive game
                    mechanics. AI excites me because it pushes problem-solving to another level, while game development speaks to my creativity and love for immersive experiences. Even though they’re different fields, both require strong logic, design
                    thinking, and patience, things I’m slowly building every day.

                    Being a working student has shaped how I approach my goals. My days are packed with school from morning to evening, and my nights are spent working from home as a customer service representative. It’s exhausting, but it taught me discipline in ways no
                    class ever could. I don’t have the luxury of procrastinating or “waiting for motivation.” Every free moment matters, and that mindset carries over to how I study programming, practice problem-solving, and plan my future.

                    Right now, I’m aware that wanting to be a software engineer isn’t enough. I still need to strengthen my fundamentals, data structures, algorithms, clean coding practices, and system thinking. Beyond technical skills, I’m learning that communication, patience,
                    and resilience matter just as much. My current job may not be tech-related, but dealing with people daily improved how I handle pressure, explain things clearly, and stay calm, skills I know will help me in team-based software projects
                    later on.

                <p class="pblog">
                    The future version of me doesn’t happen overnight. He’s built through long school days, night shifts, missed sleep, and small wins that don’t always look impressive from the outside. My biggest realization is that progress doesn’t always feel exciting,
                    it often feels tiring. But I’m learning to trust the process. As long as I keep showing up, improving, and staying curious, I know I’m moving closer to the software engineer I want to become. And for now, that’s enough to keep going.
