                        <sup>1</sup>Alright, let's start at the very beginning, shall we?
                        <sup>2</sup>My name is Sean Kirby E. Reales, I was born in Manila and was raised in Parañaque.
                        <sup>3</sup>My family lived in a small house, the size of a typical studio apartment but I was happy enough to live in it.
                        <sup>4</sup>I was a typical kid in the slums, I remember waking up to the sound of airplanes passing by every morning since we were living nearby the airport.
                        <sup>5</sup>The noise used to annoy me so much since it wakes me up and even made the TV signal weak.
                        <sup>6</sup>My parents worked <ins>hard</ins> to provide for me so I was living very content with my life even though we were poor at the time.
                        <sup>7</sup>I spent my afternoons like a typical kid in 2000s, playing with my childhood friends.
                        <sup>8</sup>We played all sorts of games like sipa, tumbang preso, langit lupa, etc.
                        <sup>9</sup>Sometimes, we also played inside of my house, playing monopoly or a random lego pieces box that my grandpa's boss gave to me.
                        <sup>10</sup>Those two toys/games really developed my creativity and logical thinking.
                        <sup>11</sup>On certain days though, I was stuck keeping an eye on the sari-sari store that my grandparents had, which <del>frustrated</del> me because I wanted to play instead.
                        <sup>12</sup>Looking back, I now realize they were teaching me responsibility even if I didn’t appreciate it then.
                        <sup>13</sup>School was a short walk from our house (maybe 5-10 minutes) and I enjoyed walking with my friends.
                        <sup>14</sup>I liked reading books ever since I was a kid, it was all I ever did to pass time in school.
                        <sup>15</sup>I wouldn’t say I was exceptionally smart, but I consistently ranked within the top five of my class throughout elementary school.
                        <sup>16</sup>Despite that, I was a <var>lazy</var>, forgetful, and easily distracted from my studies.
                        <sup>17</sup>I remember my uncle/aunt trying to teach me math and I always ended up sleeping midway through it.
                        <sup>18</sup>They never believed me when I said I didn’t have homework because I forgot it so often.
                        <sup>19</sup>I even had to ask a nearby classmate to confirm assignments, and most of the time I did have homework, I just somehow forgot about it.
                        <sup>20</sup>These experiences made my childhood so memorable.

                    <p class="pblog">
                        <sup>1</sup>This period had a drastic change from my childhood which was so happy whereas my teenage years was full of challenges.
                        <sup>2</sup>My parents separated and I had to move away with my mom and her brother/my uncle from everything and everyone that I ever knew up to that point.
                        <sup>3</sup>At first, I didn't know what happened and just sorta welcomed the change but this adjustment was far harsher than I ever imagined.
                        <sup>4</sup>My mom and uncle was often away for work so I was left alone at home most of the time.
                        <sup>5</sup>Looking back, I was really lonely but didn't want them to worry about me so I just distracted myself with computer and video games.
                        <sup>6</sup><kbd>High school</kbd> wasn't much better either since puberty all that comes with it.
                        <sup>7</sup>I was bullied since I was a new kid and my classmates already knew each other so I had a rough time fitting in.
                        <sup>8</sup>I did fit in later on and it was somewhat enjoyable.
                        <sup>9</sup>However, when I moved up a grade, everyone that I was close with was put into a different section and I had to adjust with new people again.
                        <sup>10</sup>The constant bullying and adjustment occurred year after year and I ended up having depression and social anxiety due to it.
                        <sup>11</sup>My mom and uncle thought that it was the environment that was the issue, so in grade 10, I moved to a private school and same issue still happened.
                        <sup>12</sup>By then, I was so tired of everything and I wasn't going to school without my family knowing, going to a computer shop to pass the time.
                        <sup>13</sup>I eventually got caught and we decided that I stop going to school, which was a relief at first.
                        <sup>14</sup>After months passed by, I ended up thinking to myself "is the rest of my life going to be spent as bum?" and I resolved to prevent that future.
                        <sup>15</sup>Luckily, my mom and uncle was working from home for a company that was based in the US and they were hiring for the holidays.
                        <sup>16</sup>I thought to myself that I could easily do what they are doing at work when I was watching them so I said that I wanna work since I had nothing better to do and they referred me to the company.
                        <sup>17</sup>The company ended up hiring me for <samp>$10/hr</samp> without any interviews or anything, all I had to do was pass my resume but the condition was for my mom to train me directly, which was easily done.
                        <sup>18</sup>This period was full of character development to say the least, after 2 years of working non-stop (had two jobs and was working like 60-80 hour work week), I learned responsibility, mentality, and everything that made
                        me the way I am today.
                        <sup>19</sup>Even though I was pretty successful compared to my peers there was one regret that is still lingering in my mind, which was graduating high school.
                        <sup>20</sup>I resigned my 2nd job to finish my education and to my surprise, I was doing pretty good at high school now compared to before, I was popular, excelled at my studies due to my work ethics, and graduated with high honors.

                        <sup>1</sup>My college life is still ongoing, and as a second-year, second-semester computer science student.
                        <sup>2</sup>I am continuing to learn, grow, and adjust to the demands of academic life.
                        <sup>3</sup>Entering college felt like a new beginning after everything I had been through, and it gave me a sense of direction.
                        <sup>4</sup>At first, I struggled with the workload and the pressure to perform well, but I slowly learned how to manage my responsibilities more effectively.
                        <sup>5</sup>My previous work experience helped me develop discipline, which made handling deadlines and academic tasks easier than before.
                        <sup>6</sup>I discovered that college requires not just intelligence but consistency, patience, and proper time management.
                        <sup>7</sup>I met new people who made the experience less overwhelming and more enjoyable.
                        <sup>8</sup>Although I am still not the most sociable person, I found classmates who made me feel supported.
                        <sup>9</sup>The subjects I am taking are not always easy, especially those involving programming and mathematics, but I do my best to improve little by little.
                        <sup>10</sup>My professors encourage critical thinking, which challenges me but also motivates me.
                        <sup>11</sup>There are days when balancing school, work responsibilities, and personal life becomes difficult.
                        <sup>12</sup>Still, I remind myself how far I have come from the person who once struggled to even attend class.
                        <sup>13</sup>College also allowed me to explore my interests and develop new skills I never thought I would need.
                        <sup>14</sup>Every semester feels like another step toward building the future I want for myself.
                        <sup>15</sup>Even though I am not done yet, I already feel proud of the progress I have made.
                        <sup>16</sup>I know that finishing college will not just be a personal achievement but a symbol of everything I overcame.
                        <sup>17</sup>I am committed to completing my degree and making the most out of the remaining years ahead of me.
                        <sup>18</sup>Although the path is still long, I am determined to keep moving forward.
                        <sup>19</sup>My ongoing college journey continues to shape me into someone stronger, more disciplined, and more hopeful for what lies beyond graduation.
                        <sup>20</sup>Here's to two more years of college, cheers!
