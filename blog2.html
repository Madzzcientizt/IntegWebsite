                    People always told me being a working student builds character, and I believe them to be true since I learned responsibility and work ethic that affected my whole life but I don’t think anyone really explained what that actually feels like. Right now,
                    my days start before the sun is up and end when most people are already asleep. Sometimes I’m not even sure if I’m tired, just running on autopilot. I don’t regret choosing this path, but I won’t lie, it’s nothing like the motivational
                    quotes make it sound.

                    My typical day starts with school from 7:30 AM to 7:00 PM, and once I get home, the second half of my life begins: working from home as customer service rep. It’s not glamorous, and it definitely isn’t easy. Most <em>"nights"</em>                    I get around four hours of sleep after getting home and wake up around 12 AM to start working, then I go straight to school again the moment my work shift ends. There’s barely any space to breathe in between. People ask me how I manage,
                    and honestly, I just… do it. It feels less like a skill and more like survival at this point.

                    This isn’t actually my first time being a working student. Back in senior high school, I was also doing both, but the schedule was way more forgiving, only around six hours of school. I could still rest, watch something, game, or occasionally hang out
                    with the gang. Now everything is compressed and heavier. The workload increased, the stakes are higher, and even the expectations feel different. It’s strange how the same label, “working student” can mean completely different things
                    depending on the stage of life.

                    Most people only notice the part where I’m “ambitious”, "responsible", or “disciplined,” but they don’t see the parts I silently trade away. Sleep becomes optional, hobbies disappear, and social life turns into unread messages and postponed plans. There’s
                    a particular kind of fatigue that comes with being tired every single day, yet still having responsibilities you cannot drop. But even with all of that, I don’t feel like quitting. If anything, it made me realize how much I value the
                    things I’m working for.

                    Being a working student taught me that growth doesn’t always look inspirational, sometimes it looks like eye bags, power naps, and surviving on coffee. But it also taught me resilience and how much I’m capable of handling when I don’t have a choice. If
                    there’s one thing I’m taking with me from this period, it’s that the hardest seasons usually prepare you for the ones you want. And maybe in the future, when things finally slow down, I’ll look back at this version of myself with respect
                    instead of exhaustion.
